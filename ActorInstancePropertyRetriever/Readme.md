## Actor Instance Property Retriever (AIPR)

The **Actor Instance Property Retriever (AIPR)** is a tool designed to be used on Unreal Engine 5 to gather all the levels where an actor is being used, consult any property and store the results in a .csv file. The AIPR is comprised by two files, a Widget, and a Pyhton script. 

### How does the AIPR work?

Once the user has selected an actor in the widget and an optional property to query, the tool will gather all the levels where the selected actor is in use, will open them automatically and individually and will store the results in a .csv file.
